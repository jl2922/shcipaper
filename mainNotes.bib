@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Since the absolute values of $c_i$ for the most important determinants tends to go down as more determinants are included in the wavefunction, a somewhat better selection of determinants is obtained by using a larger value of $\epsilon _1$ in the initial iterations."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We employ the Trail-Needs pseudopotential~\cite {TraNee-JCP-15}, but the conclusions of this paper would be the same for an all-electron calculation."}
