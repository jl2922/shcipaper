Abstract = {{The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has
established itself over the last decade as the leading method for
the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional
strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further devel-
opment of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a
highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix prod-
uct states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of
the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential
and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposi-
tion of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to
make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algo-
rithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to dis-
cuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic
development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still
see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a num-
ber of recently introduced algorithms.}}
